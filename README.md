Comparing flight prices

When looking on Skyscanner for flights,
I noticed that setting my Country to "Uzbekistan" instead of "UK",
lowered the same flight from 262USD to 258USD.

This code is no where finished,
we're just gettings started.

## Design

+ Chrome extension: loops through all the permutations and send data to server
+ Server: REST-API with SQL server
+ UI: Don't have a clue yet, we'll first gather the data
